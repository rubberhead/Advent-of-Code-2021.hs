Advent-of-Code-2021.???
======================

So yeah. I decided to follow the cool kidsâ„¢ from Uni and have a kick at Advent of Code. Mostly C++ to shone my "pure" programming skills but sometimes Python as well (Plz don't talk about the Haskells, I have dishonoured Professor Wadler and will commit sudoku once I wrap up this adventure).
